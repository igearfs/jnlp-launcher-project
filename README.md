# üåà **JNLP Launcher ‚Äì Beta v1.0** üåà

* Works with Mirth Connect 4.5.2 

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: BACKUP YOUR `jnlp_entries.txt` FILE!** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
Before running this version, **make a backup** of your JNLP entries! The universe is unpredictable, and while we‚Äôve done our best to keep things smooth, bad juju can still sneak in. Protect your data before proceeding! üò±

‚ö†Ô∏è ** MOVE YOUR FILE INTO THE DATA DIRECTORY FROM THE OLD PATH ON WINDOWS to: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\SyncSyndicate\data\jnlp_entries.txt INTO THE DATA FOLDER IN THE PROJECT **
‚ö†Ô∏è Ô∏è ** If you use the .exe installer let it make the directory for you after the first run and replace or drop in your jnlp_entries.txt into the correct folder. (may be different for installer just look in roaming folders for SyncSyndicate)
